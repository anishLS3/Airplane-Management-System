Here are the steps to replicate the app on your laptop:
First and foremost, extract the above zip file.

#### Stage-I: Feeding data into the database

1. Enter the `dbms_import` folder, and then the `import_scripts` folder.
2. Open `import.py` and add your SQLPLUS username and password.
3. Open SQLPLUS on your laptop, and keep it open.
4. Run `import.py`.

If the terminal shows "successful," data has completed loading into your database.

#### Stage-II: Editing out password in the Django project

1. Open the `django_project` folder in your VS-CODE.
2. Open the `views.py` file in the following folders: `airplanes`, `models`, `technicians`, `tests`.
3. Change the password in the `oracledb.connect` function call.
4. Please check and change the password in all functions in the same file.
5. Please check and change the password in all the mentioned folders.

#### Stage-III: Running the app

1. Open the `django_project` folder in your VS-CODE.
2. Open the VS-CODE terminal, and then type: `env/Scripts/activate`
   - If you get any permissions error, that's something wrong with your laptop so please google the error and solve it yourself.
3. Once you've entered the environment, `cd` into the `vimanam` folder.
4. Figure out the working python command using `python3 --version` (or) `py --version` (or) `python --version`.
5. If it is `python3`, then run: `python3 manage.py tailwind start`
6. Once it runs without any error, click on the plus sign shown on the VS-CODE terminal to open a new terminal tab.
7. Repeat: `env/Scripts/activate`
8. `cd` into the `vimanam` folder.
9. `python3 manage.py runserver`
10. Copy the link shown on the terminal and open it on your browser.
11. Make sure you have a valid internet connection because you need internet for the pictures to load.

That's it.
You can go through the code, I'll come on Wednesday, and clarify anything and everything about it.
