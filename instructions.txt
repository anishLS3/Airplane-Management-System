### Installing Dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal to install all the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up Django with Tailwind CSS

Here are the additional steps to set up Django with Tailwind CSS:

1. **Install Tailwind CSS with Django**:
   After installing `django-tailwind` via `requirements.txt`, you need to configure it in your Django project.

2. **Add `'django_tailwind'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`** in your `settings.py` file:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'django_tailwind',
       ...
   ]
   ```

3. **Run Tailwind Installation**:
   Create a new Tailwind app:

   ```sh
   python manage.py tailwind init
   ```

   This will set up a new Tailwind app within your Django project.

4. **Configure Tailwind**:
   Add the newly created Tailwind app to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and set it as the `TAILWIND_APP_NAME` in your `settings.py`:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'theme',  # or the name of the tailwind app created
       ...
   ]

   TAILWIND_APP_NAME = 'theme'  # replace 'theme' with the name of your Tailwind app
   ```

5. **Run Tailwind**:
   To start the Tailwind CSS watcher for development:

   ```sh
   python manage.py tailwind start
   ```

   For production builds, use:

   ```sh
   python manage.py tailwind build
   ```

### Example Structure of `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_tailwind',
    'theme',  # replace 'theme' with your Tailwind app name
    ...
]

TAILWIND_APP_NAME = 'theme'

# Oracle Database Configuration
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.oracle',
        'NAME': 'your_oracle_db',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'your_db_host',
        'PORT': 'your_db_port',
    }
}

# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "static"]

# Compress static files including CSS
INSTALLED_APPS += ['compressor']
STATICFILES_FINDERS = [
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
    'compressor.finders.CompressorFinder',
]
```

### Tailwind CSS Configuration:

Configure Tailwind CSS in the `tailwind.config.js` file located within your Tailwind app directory. This is where you can customize the Tailwind setup to suit your project's needs.

With these steps, your Django project should be set up with Oracle database support, and Tailwind CSS integrated for styling.

### Steps to run the project

Here are the steps to replicate the app on your laptop:
First and foremost, extract the above zip file.

#### Stage-I: Feeding data into the database

1. Enter the `dbms_import` folder, and then the `import_scripts` folder.
2. Open `import.py` and add your SQLPLUS username and password.
3. Open SQLPLUS on your laptop, and keep it open.
4. Run `import.py`.

If the terminal shows "successful," data has completed loading into your database.

#### Stage-II: Editing out password in the Django project

1. Open the `django_project` folder in your VS-CODE.
2. Open the `views.py` file in the following folders: `airplanes`, `models`, `technicians`, `tests`.
3. Change the password in the `oracledb.connect` function call.
4. Please check and change the password in all functions in the same file.
5. Please check and change the password in all the mentioned folders.

#### Stage-III: Running the app

1. Open the `django_project` folder in your VS-CODE.
2. Open the VS-CODE terminal, and then type: `env/Scripts/activate`
   - If you get any permissions error, that's something wrong with your laptop so please google the error and solve it yourself.
3. Once you've entered the environment, `cd` into the `vimanam` folder.
4. Figure out the working python command using `python3 --version` (or) `py --version` (or) `python --version`.
5. If it is `python3`, then run: `python3 manage.py tailwind start`
6. Once it runs without any error, click on the plus sign shown on the VS-CODE terminal to open a new terminal tab.
7. Repeat: `env/Scripts/activate`
8. `cd` into the `vimanam` folder.
9. `python3 manage.py runserver`
10. Copy the link shown on the terminal and open it on your browser.
11. Make sure you have a valid internet connection because you need internet for the pictures to load.

That's it.
You can go through the code, I'll come on Wednesday, and clarify anything and everything about it.
